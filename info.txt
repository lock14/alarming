b.    Special Instructions

      - Make sure device alarm and media volume are turned on.


c.    List of features

      - Ability to set multiple alarms at a user specified time and have the alarm
        go off at the set time.

      - User's alarm list sorted by alarm time from least to greatest, where
        12:00 AM is considered the least time and 11:59 PM the greatest time.

      - The ability to record and save multiple recordings.

      - The abilty to choose recording from saved recordings to play when the alarm
        goes off. If this choice is selected, the recording will play followed by
        alarm ringtone when alarm goes off.

      - Ability to select alarm ringtone.

      - Five objectives that the user may select between in order to disable the
        alarm. Objectives are Math, Tic-Tac-Toe, Swipe, Typing, and FallingShapes.

      - Ability to choose no objective. If this is selected, disable button merely
        turns alarm off rather than launch an objective activity.

      - Three difficulty levels for objectives. Easy, Medium, Hard. Diffulcty can
        be chosen on a per alarm basis.

      - Full UI support with theme and graphics


d.    Incomplete Features

      - Currently, when creating an alarm, objective difficulty defaults to medium.
        We would like to implement a global setting where the User can specify what
        the default difficulty should be.

      - Ability to select a song as alarm sound (Future Release section of design doc).

      - Cloud interface where users can download more objectives and audio recordings
        (Future Release section of design doc).


e.    Added Features not in Design Document

      - Ability to select alarm ringtone.
      - Ability to set objective difficulty
      - Ability to choose no objective.


f.    Code obtained from other sources
    
      Two classes involve code from Tutorial 3. This code is to implement a TicTacToe
      objective. The classes are:
      - TicTacToeGame.java
      - TicTacToeObjective.java

      The following Libraries were used.
      - Google Gson: https://github.com/google/gson
      - PatternLock: https://github.com/DreaminginCodeZH/PatternLock

      The code that uses these these libaries was our own save for the following:

      - We had trouble using Gson to serialize Uri objects. We used the code snippet in the top post of this stack overflow post
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22533432/create-object-from-gson-string-doesnt-work

        This code is located at lines 476-488 of our MainActivity.java class


g.    Code completed ourselves

      All classes and code other than those mentioned in section f. were written by us
