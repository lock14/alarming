# Alarming
CS 371m App Project

This is a small alarm clock app implemented as a class project for CS 371m at the University of Texas as Austin.
The app is an alarm clock app with two main additional features over standard alarm clock apps. First, the user
can record a message that will play when the alarm clock goes off (the message will play and then transition into
the alarm ringer). Second, the app comes with 5 objectives / minigames. The user can select an objective along with
a difficulty level when making an alarm. When the alarm goes off, the user must first complete the objective before the
alarm is allowed to be turned off. Both of these features are optional and the user is allowed to make a regular alarm
that has no recorded message or objective.

The app was developed over a 3 week period and thus is a little rough around the edges. It is feature complete and
(mostly) bug free. The UI could probably use additional polish, but it doesn't look half bad as it stands. For now,
this project has ceased development.
