Hello!

Thank you for reviewing Alarming! We hope you enjoy this qwerky alarm.

The applicaiton should work for a minimum API level of 16. If you are planning
to use an emulator, we recommend an emulator of the Google Pixel device.

Things to note:

	- When you set an alarm, the alarm time will also include the seconds within
	the current minute. For example, If you set an alarm for 7:04 pm it will
	not go off exactly at 7:04 but sometime during the minute of 7:04. This is
	a recent bug we've noticed and we will be fixing it for beta. Thus, if
	you set an alarm, please wait throughout the entire minute before assuming
	the alarm does not work. 

	- When editing an alarm, you will be setting 4 things:
		1. Time of the alarm
		2. Title of the alarm
		3. Recording of the alarm
		4. Objective of the alarm

	- When your alarm goes off, a default sound will play after your recording
	has completed playback. Because of this, don't feel inclined to make a
	long recording. Although, we do recommend having fun with it ;D
