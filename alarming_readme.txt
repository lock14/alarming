Hello!

Thank you for reviewing Alarming! We hope you enjoy this qwerky alarm.

The applicaiton should work for a minimum API level of 16. If you are planning
to use an emulator, we recommend an emulator of the Google Pixel device.

Things to note:

	- When editing an alarm, you will be setting 4 things:
		1. Time of the alarm
		2. Title of the alarm
		3. Recording of the alarm
		4. Objective of the alarm

	- When your alarm goes off, a default sound will play after your recording
	has completed playback. Because of this, don't feel inclined to make a
	long recording. Although, we do recommend having fun with it ;D
